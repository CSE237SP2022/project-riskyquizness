# Risky Quizness Iteration 3
by Christina Cai, Guenevere Chang, Jiwon Choi, and Katherine Zhou

## What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed a leaderboard function that saves user scores for each given quiz taken, an edit function for users to edit during the quiz creation process, user instructions when the program is launched for a pleasant user experiance, and added javadocs for smooth navigation through the code base. We continued to create as many tests as possible and practiced code cleanliness guidelines. 
We completed issues #25 and #42, on our Github project management board, which reflect a more detailed description of our work.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
A bash script is provided. Run ./script.sh

# Risky Quizness Iteration 2
by Christina Cai, Guenevere Chang, Jiwon Choi, and Katherine Zhou

## What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed cancelling quiz in the middle of creating it, saving scores for a future leaderboard, as well as a user can cancel quiz in the middle of taking a quiz. We are still working through continuing to create as many tests as possible and practicing code cleanliness practices. 
We completed issues #26, #27, #29, #32-#34, and #40 on our Github project management board, which reflect a more detailed description of our work.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
While we are still developing what we would like to focus on in creating in our next iteration, we have come up with a few new features we would like to
work on in the final iteration.
For example:
- We would like the user to be able to edit a quiz they create.
- We would like to have a leaderboard for users to view their saved scores.
- We would also like to potentially explore the idea of sharing quizzes with friends. 
These functions will significantly contribute to the social experience of our application.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
We are saving scores currently in a hashmap, but we have not printed out a leaderboard currently. We are planning on getting leaderboard functionality in the next iteration. 

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
A bash script is provided. Run ./script.sh

# Risky Quizness Iteration 1
by Christina Cai, Guenevere Chang, Jiwon Choi, and Katherine Zhou

## What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed the basic foundational user stories of making and taking a quiz.
Within these stories, users can select whether they would like to create or take a quiz,
create a quiz with personalized questions and answer choices at any length of choice, and take a quiz and receive a score based on accuracy at the end.
We completed issues #6-#18 on our Github project management board, which reflect a more detailed description of our work.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
While we are still developing what we would like to focus on in creating in our next iteration, we have come up with a few new features we would like to
work on in the next iteration or the final iteration.
For example:
- A user can edit a quiz after making it
- A user's score from the quiz is saved for a leaderboard
- Invalid input is shown if the user inputs a letter instead of a number for the number of questions
- An option to cancel the quiz creation process in the middle
- An option to exit or close out the program after using it
These functions will significantly contribute to the user experience.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
We have some instances of invalid input cases that have not been handled, such as if a user types in a letter instead of a number when asked for
number of questions in the quiz.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
A bash script is provided. Run ./script.sh
